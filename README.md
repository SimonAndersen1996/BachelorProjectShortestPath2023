# BachelorProjectShortestPath2023
My bachelor project where i had to create an OSM (Open Street Map) parser to look through and isolate importen data. Afterwards i create several algortihms to find the shortest and most optimal path  


Most importen Files are the ALT, Astar, Dijkstra 1 and 2, bidirectional Dijkstra MyOSMParser and Main.
